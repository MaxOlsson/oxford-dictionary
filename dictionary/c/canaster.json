  ],
  "origin": "Late 18th century; earliest use found in Gazetteer &amp; New Daily Advertiser. Probably from Dutch kanaster, † canaster, specific semantic development of kanaster reed basket from either Portuguese canastro reed basket or perhaps Spanish canastro reed basket (although this is first attested slightly later: 1617 or earlier), both ultimately from ancient Greek κάναστρον. The tobacco is so called on account of the fact that it was formerly transported in reed baskets.",
