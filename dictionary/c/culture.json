  "origin": "Middle English (denoting a cultivated piece of land): the noun from French culture or directly from Latin cultura growing, cultivation; the verb from obsolete French culturer or medieval Latin culturare, both based on Latin colere tend, cultivate (see cultivate). In late Middle English the sense was cultivation of the soil and from this (early 16th century), arose cultivation (of the mind, faculties, or manners); culture (sense 1 of the noun) dates from the early 19th century.",
