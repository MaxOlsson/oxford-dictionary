  "origin": "Old English clūt (in the sense a patch or metal plate); related to Dutch kluit lump, clod, also to cleat and clot. The shift of sense to heavy blow, which dates from late Middle English, is difficult to explain; possibly the change occurred first in the verb (from put a patch on to hit hard).",
