  "origin": "Late 16th century: diminutive of Jock. Originally the name for an ordinary man, lad, or underling, the word came to mean mounted courier, hence the current sense (late 17th century). Another early use horse-dealer (long a byword for dishonesty) probably gave rise to the verb sense manipulate, whereas the main verb sense probably relates to the behavior of jockeys manoeuvring for an advantageous position during a race.",
