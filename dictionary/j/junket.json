  "origin": "Late Middle English: from Old French jonquette rush basket, from jonc rush, from Latin juncus. Originally denoting a rush basket, especially one for fish (remaining in dialect use), the term also denoted a cream cheese, formerly made in a rush basket or served on a rush mat. A later extended sense, feast, merrymaking, gave rise to junket (sense 2 of the noun).",
