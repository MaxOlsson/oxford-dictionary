  "origin": "Late 16th century; earliest use found in Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland. Probably a variant of russel, perhaps with assimilation of liquids ( r…l goes to r…r), or perhaps showing suffix substitution; perhaps compare also French rousseur redness, reddish colour. The forms with final -t, -d apparently show an excrescent final plosive.",
