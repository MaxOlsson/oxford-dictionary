Origin uncertain; probably related to early modern Danish røste to cook on a grill over a fire, to grill, broil (Danish riste), cognate with Norwegian riste, Swedish rista, in the same sense, probably ultimately representing a borrowing of Middle Low German rōsten, rȫsten to roast: see roast&lt;br&gt;late 18th century; earliest use found in Songs from David Herd's Manuscripts. Originally a variant of rest, now usually distinguished in form in the senses below. Earlier currency is probably implied by reesty.",
