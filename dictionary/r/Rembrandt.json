      "description": "(1606–69), Dutch painter; full name Rembrandt Harmensz van Rijn. He established his reputation as a portrait painter with the Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Tulp (1632). In The Night Watch (1642), he used chiaroscuro to give his subjects a more spiritual and introspective quality. Rembrandt is identified with the series of more than sixty self-portraits painted from 1629 to 1669."
