  "origin": "Mid 19th century. Originally from German Redowak from Czech rejdovák, denoting a Bohemian folk dance. In some forms apparently from Polish redowa, probably (with unexplained alteration of the ending) from Czech rejdovák, perhaps originally via French rédowa or its etymon German Redowa (although both of these are apparently first attested slightly later: 1845 or earlier in French and 1849 or earlier in German; both are ultimately from Czech, probably via the Polish form).",
