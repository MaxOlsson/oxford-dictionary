  "origin": "Middle English: from Old French baterie, from battre to strike, from Latin battuere. The original sense was metal articles wrought by hammering, later a number of pieces of artillery used together, whence a number of Leyden jars connected up so as to discharge simultaneously (mid 18th century), giving rise to battery (sense 1).",
