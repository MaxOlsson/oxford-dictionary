    }
  ],
  "origin": "Early 19th century. From scientific Latin Bulimus, genus name, apparently an error for or alteration of scientific Latin Bulinus, earlier name of the genus; from French bulin (Adanson, 1757, loc. cit.) from bulle bubble + -in, so called on account of the fact that after the snail's death its shell floats like a little bubble of air), perhaps by association with ancient Greek βούλιμος. Post-classical Latin bulimus is also attested denoting an internal parasite (in an undated glossary and in an 8th-cent. British glossarial source).",
  "pronounciation": "/ˈbjuːlɪməs/"
