  "origin": "Mid 17th century; earliest use found in Thomas Blount (1618–1679), antiquary and lexicographer. From classical Latin disclūsiōn-, disclūsiō state of being separated off (2nd cent. a.d. in Apuleius) from disclūs-, past participial stem of disclūdere + -iō&lt;br&gt;1960s; earliest use found in American Journal Orthodontics. Apparently a remodelling of disocclusion, with loss of the second syllable perhaps by association with e.g. inclusion, exclusion, conclusion, etc. Compare earlier (in dentistry) retroclusion.",
