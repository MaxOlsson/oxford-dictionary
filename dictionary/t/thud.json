  "origin": "Late Middle English (originally Scots): probably from Old English thyddan to thrust, push; related to thoden violent wind. The noun is recorded first denoting a sudden blast or gust of wind, later the sound of a thunderclap, whence a dull, heavy sound. The verb dates from the early 16th century.",
