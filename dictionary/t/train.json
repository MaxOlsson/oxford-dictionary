  "origin": "Middle English (as a noun in the sense delay): from Old French train (masculine), traine (feminine), from trahiner (verb), from Latin trahere pull, draw. Early noun senses were trailing part of a robe and retinue; the latter gave rise to line of traveling people or vehicles, later a connected series of things. The early verb sense cause a plant to grow in a desired shape was the basis of the sense instruct.",
