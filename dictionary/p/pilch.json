  "origin": "Old English. From post-classical Latin pellicia pelisse&lt;br&gt;Middle English; earliest use found in Ancrene Riwle. Probably the reflex of an unattested Old English verb *pilcian, either from *pilian + -c-, factitive suffix, or a borrowing from early Scandinavian, cognate with German regional (Low German) pilken (also polken) to pick out with the fingers or the nails, further etymology uncertain: perhaps an extended form of the Germanic base of Middle Dutch pellen to peel, hull (Dutch pellen), Middle Low German pellen to skin (German regional (Low German) pellen, pillen to peel), ultimately from classical Latin pellis or pilāre to deprive of hair or feathers. In Orkney and Shetland use from the unattested Norn reflex of the early Scandinavian word represented by the Scandinavian forms listed above.",
