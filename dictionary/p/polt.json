  "origin": "Early 17th century; earliest use found in MS Bodleian 30. Probably from polt, although first attested earlier. Perhaps compare palt. It is not certain that sense 2 shows the same word; compare polt-foot&lt;br&gt;mid 17th century; earliest use found in Walter Blith (bap. 1605, d. 1654), writer on husbandry. Apparently ultimately related to pilt, although the form is difficult to account for; perhaps developed from the past tense forms at pilt. Perhaps compare palt.",
