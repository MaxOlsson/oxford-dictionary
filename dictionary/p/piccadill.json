  "origin": "Early 17th century; earliest use found in Thomas Dekker (c1572–1632), playwright and pamphleteer. From French † piccadille inside part of a sleeve, glossed in Cotgrave as the seuerall diuisions or peeces fastened together about the brimme of the collar of a doublet, of uncertain origin. Spanish picadillo has been suggested as the etymon of the French word, but is apparently only attested in the sense minced meat, hash; however, compare picadura ornamental gusset, and also Occitan picadura embroidered textile.",
