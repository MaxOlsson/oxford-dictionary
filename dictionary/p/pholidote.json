From ancient Greek ϕολιδωτός covered with scales from Hellenistic Greek ϕολιδοῦσθαι to be covered in scales, although this is apparently first attested later (from ancient Greek ϕολιδ-, ϕολίς scale, perhaps from the same Indo-European base as Russian bolona growth on trees, bolon′ soft bark, Czech blána skin) + -τός, suffix forming verbal adjectives. In later use after scientific Latin Pholidota, order name.",
