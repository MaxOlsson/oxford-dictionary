  "origin": "Late 16th century; earliest use found in 1st Part Raigne Selimus. Origin unknown. With the first element perhaps compare pug. It is unclear whether -wiggen, -wiggin in the some forms represent pronunciations with affricate/dʒ/ or plosive/ɡ/, although the rhyme with biggin in quot. 1675 at sense A. 2 strongly suggests the latter. In some forms apparently altered by association with wigeon.",
