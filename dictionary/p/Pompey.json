Suggested explanations for the use include an association with the name of the French ship La Pompeé (captured by the British in 1793 and subsequently based at Portsmouth), or with an ancient column in Alexandria nicknamed Pompey's Pillar (reportedly scaled by sailors from Portsmouth), but no documentation has been found to support these theories.",
