  ],
  "origin": "Mid 16th century; earliest use found in Thomas Elyot (c1490–1546), humanist and diplomat. From prick + madam, apparently with reference to the astringent taste of the stonecrop's leaves. Apparently related to Middle French, French (now regional) trique-madame stonecrop, although the exact nature of the relationship is unclear; the French word is apparently an unexplained variant of tripe-madame.",
  "pronounciation": "/ˈprɪkmadəm/"
