  "origin": "Middle English; earliest use found in Hali Meidenhad: an alliterative homily. Origin uncertain. Compare German regional (Low German) proken to prod, poke, scratch, scrawl, and also Middle Low German prȫkeln (variant of prēkelen to prick, pierce, to incite; German regional (Low German: East Friesland) prökeln; perhaps compare 20th-cent. Scots prokel, apparently a frequentative formation from the present word). Compare also Middle Low German prēkel, German regional (Low German: East Friesland) prökel prickle, pointed instrument. The further origin of all of these words is uncertain: the form and sense suggest a relationship with prick, poke, or prog.",
