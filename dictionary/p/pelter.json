  "origin": "Middle English; earliest use found in Feet Fines of Kent. Partly from pelt + -er, and partly from Anglo-Norman pelter, variant of peleter pelleter. Compare Middle Dutch pelser skinner, (rarely) furrier (Dutch † pelser), Middle Low German pelser, pelzer, Middle High German belzer furrier (German † Pelzer)&lt;br&gt;early 18th century; earliest use found in Jonathan Swift (1667–1745), writer and dean of St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin. From pelt + -er&lt;br&gt;mid 19th century; earliest use found in The Spirit of the Times: a chronicle of the turf, agriculture, field sports, literature and the stage. Origin uncertain; perhaps a transferred use of pelter, in allusion to the mud thrown up by a horse's hoofs when traveling on muddy roads ( Dict. American Eng s.v.), although it is unclear why this should apply particularly to an inferior horse; a connection with pelter is unlikely given the chronological gap; ironic use of pelter is also unlikely, as this is first attested later&lt;br&gt;late 17th century; earliest use found in Matthew Stevenson (d. 1684), poet. From pelt + -er.",
