  "origin": "Middle English: from Old French livree delivered, feminine past participle of livrer, from Latin liberare liberate (in medieval Latin hand over). The original sense was the dispensing of food, provisions, or clothing to servants; hence livery (sense 4), also allowance of provender for horses, surviving in the phrase at livery and in livery stable. livery (sense 1) arose because medieval nobles provided matching clothes to distinguish their servants from others'.",
