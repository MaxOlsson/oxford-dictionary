  "origin": "Late Middle English: from Latin incorrectus, from in- not + correctus made straight, amended (see correct). Originally in the general sense uncorrected, the word was later applied specifically to a book containing many errors because it had not been corrected for the press; hence incorrect (sense 2) (late 17th century).",
