  "origin": "Late Middle English: from Latin index, indic- forefinger, informer, sign, from in- towards + a second element related to dicere say or dicare make known; compare with indicate. The original sense index finger (with which one points), came to mean pointer (late 16th century), and figuratively something that serves to point to a fact or conclusion; hence a list of topics in a book (pointing to their location).",
