  "origin": "Mid 16th century: from a- (expressing direction) + luff. The term was originally an adverb in nautical use, meaning away and to windward!, i.e. with the ship's head kept close to the wind away from a lee shore etc. towards which it might drift. From this arose the sense at a distance.",
