  "origin": "Old English æce (noun), acan (verb). In Middle English and early modern English the noun was spelled atche and rhymed with batch and the verb was spelled and pronounced as it is today. The noun began to be pronounced like the verb around 1700. The modern spelling is largely due to Dr Johnson, who mistakenly assumed its derivation to be from Greek akhos pain.",
