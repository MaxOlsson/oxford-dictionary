The original sense, the surgical treatment of fractures, probably came via Spanish, in which it survives; the mathematical sense comes from the title of a book, ilm al-jabr wa'l-muqābala the science of restoring what is missing and equating like with like, by the mathematician al-Ḵwārizmī (see algorithm).",
