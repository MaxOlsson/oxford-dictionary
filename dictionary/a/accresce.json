  "origin": "Mid 16th century; earliest use found in William Stewart (fl. 1499–1541), chronicler and poet. Probably partly from classical Latin accrēscere to increase in size, grow larger, to grow big, to grow up, to increase, (of increments) to be added, to accrue, in post-classical Latin also (transitive) to add to, and partly a variant (with short vowel) of accrease, with remodelling of the ending after verbs in -esce. With later use compare also accrescence.",
