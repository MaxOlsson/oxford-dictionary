  "origin": "Middle English amonest urge, exhort, from Old French amonester, based on Latin admonere urge by warning. Later, the final -t of amonest was taken to indicate the past tense, and the present tense changed on the pattern of verbs such as abolish; the prefix became ad- in the 16th century by association with the Latin form.",
