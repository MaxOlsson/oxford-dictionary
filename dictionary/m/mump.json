  "origin": "Late 18th century (in an earlier sense). Origin uncertain: perhaps alteration of lump, or perhaps specifically use of singular form corresponding to mumps&lt;br&gt;late 16th century (in an earlier sense). Apparently from an imitative base of Germanic origin. Compare Dutch mompen to mumble (rare, poetic), German † mumpfen to chew with a full mouth, Icelandic mumpa to cackle, to mutter, murmur, mumpra to eat greedily, to mumble, to distort the mouth, Norwegian regional mompe, mumpe to chew with a full mouth, stuff oneself&lt;br&gt;mid 17th century (in an earlier sense). Apparently from Dutch mompen to cheat, deceive, conceal, of uncertain origin; perhaps related to mompen to mumble, though the nature of the relationship is unclear.",
