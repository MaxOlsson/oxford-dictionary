  "origin": "Early 17th century; earliest use found in Ben Jonson (?1573–1637), poet and playwright. From post-classical Latin mammothreptus kept at the breast too long from Hellenistic Greek or Byzantine Greek μαμμόθρεπτος brought up by one's grandmother from Hellenistic Greek μάμμη grandmother + θρεπτός, adjective from the base of τρέϕειν to bring up. St Augustine's use of this rare Greek word is surprising, since he did not know Greek; an earlier post-classical Latin source may have been lost. The Latin sense is probably influenced by classical Latin mamma.",
