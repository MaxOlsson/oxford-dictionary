From Anglo-Norman marschalcie, marchalsie, marchaucie marshal's court, marshalship, farriery (compare Old French mareschalcie farriery, mareschaucie office of marshal, Middle French marescalcie jurisdiction of marshals) from post-classical Latin mariscalcia farriery, office of marshal, department in the royal household, marshal's court or prison from mariscalcus + -ia. The some forms reflect Old French mairichauciée stable, Middle French mareschalchée office of marshal, mareschaussée jurisdiction of marshal, French maréchaussée jurisdiction of marshals, gendarmerie from Old French mareschaucie, with substitution of the suffix -ée; compare the corresponding post-classical Latin form mariscalciata.",
