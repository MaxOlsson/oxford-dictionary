From mouse (or occasionally its plural mice) + pease; in later use in some forms the second element was probably apprehended as plural. In some forms a re-formation from mouse + pea. In some forms from the genitive of mouse + the plural of pea; compare the parallel formation represented by Scots mousie's pea.",
