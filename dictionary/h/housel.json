  "origin": "Old English (in an earlier sense). Cognate with early Scandinavian (runic: Sweden) (dative singular) hosli sacrifice, Old Icelandic húsl (Icelandic húsl, hunsl, now hist.), Old Norwegian húsl, Old Swedish husl, all in sense the Eucharist, the consecrated elements of the Eucharist, Gothic hunsl sacrifice, offering (translating ancient Greek θυσία), also (in an isolated attestation: John 16:2, translating ancient Greek λατρεία) service to God, worship; further etymology uncertain and disputed: see below. The word is probably a Christian semantic development of an originally pagan term; with the development of sense 2, compare the concept of the Eucharist as sacrifice (in Catholic and Orthodox theology)&lt;br&gt;Old English (in an earlier sense). From housel. Compare Old Icelandic húsla (Icelandic húsla, hunsla, now hist.), Old Swedish husla.",
