      "description": "(1901–89), emperor of Japan 1926–89; full name Michinomiya Hirohito. Regarded as the 124th direct descendant of Jimmu, he refrained from involvement in politics, although he was instrumental in obtaining Japan's agreement to the unconditional surrender that ended World War II. In 1946, the new constitution imposed by the US obliged him to renounce his divinity and become a constitutional monarch."
