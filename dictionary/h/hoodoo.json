  "origin": "Late 19th century (originally US): apparently an alteration of voodoo. It originally denoted a person who practiced voodoo, hence a hidden cause of bad luck ( hoodoo (sense 1 of the noun)). hoodoo (sense 2 of the noun) is apparently due to the resemblance of the rock column to a strange human form, often topped by an overhanging hat of harder rock.",
