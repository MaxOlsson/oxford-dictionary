  "origin": "Middle English: via Old French from Latin humor moisture, from humere (see humid). The original sense was bodily fluid (surviving in aqueous humour and vitreous humour); it was used specifically for any of the cardinal humors ( humor (sense 3 of the noun)), whence mental disposition (thought to be caused by the relative proportions of the humors). This led, in the 16th century, to the senses mood ( humor (sense 2 of the noun)) and whim, hence to humour someone to indulge a person's whim. humor (sense 1 of the noun) dates from the late 16th century.",
