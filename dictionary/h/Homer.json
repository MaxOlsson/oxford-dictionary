      "description": "(8th century BC), Greek epic poet. He is traditionally held to be the author of the Iliad and the Odyssey, although modern scholarship has revealed the place of the Homeric poems in a preliterate oral tradition. In later antiquity, Homer was regarded as the greatest poet, and his poems were constantly used as a model and source by others."
