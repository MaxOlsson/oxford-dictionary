      "description": "A German family of scientific entrepreneurs and engineers. Ernst Werner von Siemens (1816–92) was an electrical engineer who developed the process of electroplating, devised an electric generator that used an electromagnet, and pioneered electrical traction. His brother Karl Wilhelm (1823–83) (also known as Sir Charles William Siemens ) moved to England, where he developed the open-hearth steel furnace and designed the cable-laying steamship Faraday. Their brother Friedrich (1826–1904) applied the principles of the open-hearth furnace to glassmaking."
