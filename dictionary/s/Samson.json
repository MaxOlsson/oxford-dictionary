      "description": "An Israelite leader (probably 11th century BC) famous for his strength (Judges 13–16). He fell in love with Delilah and confided to her that his strength lay in his long hair. She betrayed him to the Philistines, who cut off his hair and blinded him, but his hair grew again and he pulled down the pillars of a house, destroying himself and a large gathering of Philistines."
