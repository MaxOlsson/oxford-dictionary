  "origin": "Early 17th century: probably an alteration of obsolete fadge to fit. Early usage was as a verb in the sense turn out as expected, also merge together: this probably gave rise to its use in confectionery. In the late 17th century the verb came to mean fit together in a clumsy or underhand manner, which included facts or figures being cobbled together in a superficially convincing way: this led to the exclamation fudge! and to noun fudge (sense 3 of the noun).",
