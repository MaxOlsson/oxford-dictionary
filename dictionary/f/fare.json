  "origin": "Old English fær, faru traveling, a journey or expedition, faran to travel, also get on (well or badly), of Germanic origin; related to Dutch varen and German fahren to travel, Old Norse ferja ferry boat, also to ford. Sense 1 of the noun stems from an earlier meaning a journey for which a price is paid. Noun sense 2 was originally used with reference to the quality or quantity of food provided, probably from the idea of faring well or badly.",
