  "origin": "Late 16th century: from Spanish and Italian firma, from medieval Latin, from Latin firmare fix, settle (in late Latin confirm by signature), from firmus firm; compare with farm. The word originally denoted one's autograph or signature; later (mid 18th century) the name under which the business of a firm was transacted, hence the firm itself (late 18th century).",
