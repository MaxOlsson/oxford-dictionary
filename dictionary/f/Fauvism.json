  "origin": "French fauvisme, from fauve wild beast. The name originated from a remark of the French art critic Louis Vauxcelles at the Salon of 1905; coming across a quattrocento-style statue in the midst of works by Matisse and his associates, he is reputed to have said, Donatello au milieu des fauves! (Donatello among the wild beasts).",
