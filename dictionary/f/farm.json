  "origin": "Middle English: from Old French ferme, from medieval Latin firma fixed payment, from Latin firmare fix, settle (in medieval Latin contract for), from firmus constant, firm; compare with firm. The noun originally denoted a fixed annual amount payable as rent or tax; this is reflected in farm (sense 3 of the verb), which later gave rise to to subcontract ( farm (sense 2 of the verb)). The noun came to denote a lease, and, in the early 16th century, land leased for farming. The verb sense grow crops or keep livestock dates from the early 19th century.",
