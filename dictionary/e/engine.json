  "origin": "Middle English (formerly also as ingine): from Old French engin, from Latin ingenium talent, device, from in- in + gignere beget; compare with ingenious. The original sense was ingenuity, cunning (surviving in Scots as ingine), hence the product of ingenuity, a plot or snare, also tool, weapon, later specifically denoting a large mechanical weapon; whence a machine (mid 17th century), used commonly later in combinations such as steam engine, internal combustion engine.",
