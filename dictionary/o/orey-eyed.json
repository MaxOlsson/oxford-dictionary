  ],
  "origin": "Late 19th century; earliest use found in Jack London (1876–1916), writer, war correspondent, and agronomist. Apparently from a first element of uncertain identity + eyed (although compare early forms, both in J. London, in -oide, -ide). The first element may perhaps represent a pronunciation of awry, or perhaps of hoary, or perhaps compare oorie.",
