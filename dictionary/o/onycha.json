  "origin": "Late Middle English; earliest use found in The Wycliffite Bible (early version). From post-classical Latin onycha ingredient of incense consisting of the opercula of marine molluscs (Vulgate) from Hellenistic Greek ὄνυχα, accusative of ὄνυξ. The Greek word in the accusative occurs in the Septuagint in Exodus 30:34; in the nominative ὄνυξ in Ecclus. 24:16; in the latter case the Vulgate renders it ungula, but in the former leaves onycha in its Greek form; this, being apparently not recognized as the accusative of onyx, was treated by medieval writers as a distinct word; hence in English versions of the Bible.",
